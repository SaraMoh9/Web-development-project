1. Create a constant called myAge and set it to your age. Then, create a constant
named isTeenager that uses Boolean logic to determine if the age denotes
someone in the age range of 13 to 19.

void main() {
  const myAge = 25;
  const isTeenager = myAge >= 13 && myAge <= 19;
  print('Am I a teenager? $isTeenager');
}



2. Create another constant named maryAge and set it to 30. Then, create a constant
named bothTeenagers that uses Boolean logic to determine if both you and
Mary are teenagers.

void main() {
  const myAge = 25;
  const maryAge = 30;
  const bothTeenagers = (myAge >= 13 && myAge <= 19) && (maryAge >= 13 && maryAge <= 19);
  print('Are both of us teenagers? $bothTeenagers');
}



3. Create a String constant named reader and set it to your name. Create another
String constant named ray and set it to 'Ray Wenderlich'. Create a Boolean
constant named rayIsReader that uses string equality to determine if reader
and ray are equal. Now that you understand Boolean logic, you’re going to use that knowledge to make decisions in your code.

void main() {
  const reader = 'John';
  const ray = 'Ray Wenderlich';
  const rayIsReader = reader == ray;
  print('Is Ray also the reader? $rayIsReader');
}



4. Create a constant named myAge and initialize it with your age. Write an if
statement to print out “Teenager” if your age is between 13 and 19, and “Not a
teenager” if your age is not between 13 and 19.

void main() {
  const myAge = 25;
  
  if (myAge >= 13 && myAge <= 19) {
    print('Teenager');
  } else {
    print('Not a teenager');
  }
}



5. Use a ternary conditional operator to replace the else-if statement that you
used above. Set the result to a variable named answer.

void main() {
  const myAge = 25;
  
  // Using ternary conditional operator
  final answer = myAge >= 13 && myAge <= 19 ? 'Teenager' : 'Not a teenager';
  print(answer);
}
